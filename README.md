# Pose Estimation and Grasping 

This project implements a complete pipeline for 6-DoF object pose estimation from point clouds and simulated grasping using MuJoCo. The task involves estimating the pose of a known object (power drill) and executing grasps using a robot model.

## Features
- Direct pose estimation using PointNet
- Coordinate fitting-based pose refinement
- Grasp pose transformation and execution in MuJoCo simulation
